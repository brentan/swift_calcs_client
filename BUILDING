To build swift_calcs, you will need a node.js installation.
We recommend https://github.com/visionmedia/n for installing node,
otherwise, you can get it from http://nodejs.org/ .

You will then need to update the dependencies with `npm`, like so:

    % npm install

If this installs properly, you should simply be able to run `make`,
and swift_calcs will be built in the `build/` directory.  Alternatively,
for development, you can run `make app`, which will automatically
re-make, and then move the files into the applicaiton repo for testing
